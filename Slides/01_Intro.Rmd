> Offered the choice between mastery of a five-foot shelf of analytical statistics books and middling ability at performing statistical Monte Carlo simulations, we would surely choose to have the latter skill.

Apart from Monte Carlo (MC), we will cover (re-)sampling methods such as

- cross-validation
- bootstrap
- jackknife
- Bayesian MC extensions

  - in groups of 2-3 students

* project: data exploration+analysis *or* simulation study

  - 30+10 % of the grade
  - the 10 % for added value
  - in groups of 2-3 students

## Course Requirements

* 1 assignment = 5 % of the grade = 0.25 on the 1-6 grade scale

  - missing all assignments $\Rightarrow$ final grade 4.0 at best!

* R, Markdown and GitHub for the assignments and projects will be needed

  - submission of GitHub links to the Moodle needed for grading purposes
  - this is not a programming course, learn by doing!

* 2 hours of lecture per week
  - going through the course content
* 2 hours of exercises per week
  - working on assignments and projects
  - keeping up with the lecture (e.g. with R)

## Linear Models Recap

```{=tex}
\begin{tabular}{rl}
Data: &  $(Y_1,X_1)^\top,\ldots,(Y_N,X_N)^\top$, $Y_n \in \mathbb{R}$ is the response \bigskip\\
Gaussian model: &  $Y = (Y_1,\ldots,Y_N)^\top \sim \mathcal{N}(X \beta, \sigma^2 I_{N \times N})$ \\
& -- $X \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times p}$ is the model matrix containing \\
& \kern10ex (transformations of) $X_1,\ldots,X_N$ \bigskip\\
Model:& $Y \sim (X \beta, \sigma^2 I_{N \times N})$ meaning that \\
& -- $\mathbb{E} Y_n = x_n^\top \beta$ \\
& -- $\mathrm{var}(Y) = \sigma^2 I$ \bigskip\\
Least Squares:& $\mathrm{min}_{\beta} \| Y - X\beta \|_2^2$ or $\mathrm{min}_{\beta} \sum_{n}( Y_n - x_n^\top \beta)^2$ \bigskip\\
Fit:& $\widehat{\beta} = (X^\top X)^{-1} X^\top Y$ assuming $X$ is full-rank\\
& $\widehat{Y} = X (X^\top X)^{-1} X^\top Y$ are called fitted values
\end{tabular}
```





## lm Example Takeaways

* doing statistics is more than just "massaging" data and taking whatever comes out

* linear models are the bread and butter of statistics, and as all statistical methods they are most easy to work with in R

* effective visualization is important beyond reporting results (code debugging, model verification, etc.)

## lm Example Takeaways

* Jupyter Notebook (Python) or Live Script (Matlab) seem more interactive than R Markdown
  - not necessarily a good thing, e.g. reproducibility issues

* one can run R in Jupyter Notebook or conversely Python in R Markdown
  - I generally do *not* recommend either, except if you, say, work in R Markdown and want to use some Python packages (e.g. for deep learning)
  
* instead of R Markdown, one can use R Notebook (also in RStudio) to get some of the Jupyter Notebook interactivity

## RStudio

## Our Workflow

* open RStudio

* load some packages

* work in a (R Markdown) script, potentially inside a project

* save your progress

* push your changes to GitHub

[Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) -- a lot of interesting books written in R Markdown, including one of the references for this course, the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) book co-authored by Hadley Wickham.

## Good Coding Practices

* consistency (following a certain style)
* indentation
* naming conventions -- short but informative variable/function names  
  - `camelCase`
  - `snake_case` -- my personal preference
  - `dot.case` -- not bad, but some languages will not allow it
  - others such as `PascalCase` or `kebab-case` are inferior
* simplicity
* comments (more the merrier!)
* load packages at the top
* loading data comes next (possibly in a separate script)
* functions come next (possibly in a separate script)
* use `set.seed()` if RNG present
* re-run with empty environment

## Assignment

"**Assignment**" = **mandatory**, counts towards the final grade [5 %]

\bigskip

Go to [Manual 02](../Manuals/02_Github.html) and set up R, RStudio and GitHub for yourself as described there.

Make your first push to GitHub and submission to Moodle (push and submit whatever you want) as described in the [course requirements](../Manuals/01_Organization.html).

## Exercise

"**Exercise**" = does not count towards the grade

\bigskip

1. Familiarize yourselves with Markdown, and R itself by following the respective Manuals available in the GitHub repo.

2. We have done most of the analysis of the `chredlin` data in R, but we have done some pieces in Python and Matlab. Do the full analysis in R, i.e. complete the Markdown script corresponding to R translating the pieces of code from Python and Matlab. Also try to improve the model by considering transformations of (some of the variables.
