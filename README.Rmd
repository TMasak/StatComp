* [Slides](https://github.com/TMasak/StatComp/tree/master/Slides) used during the lectures,
* [Notes](https://github.com/TMasak/StatComp/tree/master/Notes), i.e. lecture notes, the basis for the slides,
  - not available for Weeks 1 and 3
* [Manuals](https://github.com/TMasak/StatComp/tree/master/Manuals) on specific topics.
  - mostly for the first couple of weeks
  
## For Starters

Clicking on an `.html` file here in GitHub does not render the page, you just see code. To render the page, put the following string in front of the respective URL: `https://htmlpreview.github.io/?`

For example, clicking [here](https://github.com/TMasak/StatComp/blob/master/Manuals/02_Github.html) opens HTML code of the GitHub manual, but clicking [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/TMasak/StatComp/blob/master/Manuals/02_Github.html) will render the page for display. This will soon not be needed once you have your RStudio <-> GitHub connection set up.
